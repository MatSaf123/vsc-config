# VSC Config files

My Visual Studio Code config files, mostly Vim motions configuration. Modified version of config available here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GST8we5uABo

You also need this VSC Vim extension installed https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim in order for this config to work.
